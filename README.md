# aliyun-fc-samples

This project exists to keep in an ordered place all the _Node.js_ samples I build for Alibaba Function Compute. I call it the "Missing Function Compute Samples Repository".

## ECS
For *ECS* instances you would need an event in JSON like `{"InstanceId":"_instance-id-here_"}`.
- `StopInstance.js`
- `StartInstance.js`
